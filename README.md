# Personal-Poker-App-Project

Hi,

Regular Poker player got an idea for:

website
-comparing hand percentages
-optimal GTO play
-implied odds/equity

I am pretty sure there are websites out there that already have these ideas.
However, I am attempting to make a personal challenge create a usable poker website/app offering data that may be perhaps usable.

Ideas are still raw. My knowledge is still limited.
Thus,
Personal project.


>>> working on HTML, lets set up a good layout of the webpage.

LAST THOUGHTS: seems like I have to create my own database. not a lot of database linking to java
